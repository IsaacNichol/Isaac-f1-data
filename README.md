# Isaac's fun with data
I am trying to self some learn basic python and database interactions.
Having an interest in F1 i figured that's a great place to start in learning with readily available data that is interesting to me.


What am i trying to do? 

From the OpenF1 api's 
https://openf1.org. Call a selection of data including sessions, drivers and positions then put those into a database ( Postgres ) for analysis.
This process includes transforming the data

See [TODO](/TODO.md) for next things i am working on 

I am using PyQT5 for a simple UI

**Future**

Once this is "working" i will create a second version which is backed by a NoSql DB ( Most likey MongoDB) for learnings

Once both versions are working i want to experiment with Shiny for python https://shiny.posit.co/py/ as a web app for analysis.
