# Isaac's fun with data
I am trying to self some learn basic python and database interactions.
Having an interest in F1 i figured that's a great place to start in learning with readily available data that is interesting to me.


What am i trying to do? 

From the OpenF1 api's 
https://openf1.org. Call a selection of data including sessions, drivers and positions then put those into a database ( Postgres ) for analysis.

Creating 3 tables sessions, drivers and positions this should give me a good basis for doing some data analysis  

See [TODO](/TODO.md) for next things i am working on 

I am using PyQT5 for a simple UI
