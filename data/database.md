# Database schema
See diagram 

Goal of this database is to remove duplicates and test ETL skills.

Where source data will not fit into each table

For example the API calls for drivers has data that will need to be split across both drivers and drivers metadata table

Database diagram and sql was built using https://dbdiagram.io which has been **incredible** for visualising the schema
